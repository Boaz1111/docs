## Overview

This proposes to add multiple weapons into the game that either talk or are esentient in another way. Think of the talking smartgun from Cyberpunk, sentient swords like the persona weapons from rimworld, or just guns with pAI's installed. 

## Background

Currently pAI's are the closest we have to this. However, they can't do anything besides from talking and playing music. It also doesn't make a lot of sense for them to be offering tactical advice(HOW CAN THEY SEE THEY'RE STUCK IN A PDA). 

## The rest?

Is entirely up to you.
